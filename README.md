# spyro: respiration analyses in Python

spyro is a respiration analysis toolbox in Python. Currently, spyro is just a port of the MATLAB toolbox [BreathMetrics](https://github.com/zelanolab/breathmetrics). If you use spyro, cite the [BreathMetrics publication](https://doi.org/10.1093/chemse/bjy045). But obviously spyro is not ready for use, so use BreathMetrics in MATLAB instead.

Some things spyro offers:

* de-noising respiratory data
* identifying inhalation/exhalation onsets, peaks, and offsets
* identifying brief pauses in breathing
* visualizing respiratory data
